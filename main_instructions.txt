Welcome to the CDL Test In-Cab Pre-Trip

you are testing the various components of
your combination vehicle which can be accessed
or controlled from inside the cab. These include:

    -Dashboard lights and gauges
    -The coupling system
    -The braking system

The different stages of the inspection can be
activated by clicking one of the four buttons 
in the corners of this window. To get started, click
the key twice to start the truck, then click 
"Display Dashboard" in the upper left corner. After
that, you can progress through the Tug Test,
