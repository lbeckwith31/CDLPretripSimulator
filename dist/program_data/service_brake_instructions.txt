Now it is time to perform the service brake
test to ensure that your service brake can
safely bring your combination vehicle to a
stop while moving.

To perfrom the service brake test, put the
truck in drive and ensure that the tractor
and trailer spring brakes are released. Press
"G" to step on the gas pedal and move the 
vehicle forward slightly, then press "B" to
engage the service brake. The brake system is
working properly if the steering wheel does
not pull to the left or right when pressing
on the service brake.
