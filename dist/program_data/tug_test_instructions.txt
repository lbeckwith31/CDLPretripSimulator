The tug test is an essential part of the 
pre-trip inspection. A successful tug test
verifies that your tractor and trailer are
properly coupled, and that the spring brakes
in the tractor and trailer are working.

To perform the tug test, put the truck in gear.
Then, release the trailer brake while leaving
the tractor brake set. Press on the gas and
ensure the vehicle does not move. Next,
repeat these steps with the tractor brake
released and the trailer brake set. Click the
"End tug test" button when finished.
