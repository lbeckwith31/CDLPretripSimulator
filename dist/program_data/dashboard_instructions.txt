To begin the in-cab portion of the pre-trip
inspection, start the truck and ensure that
the ABS light briefly lights up on your 
dashboard and on the back of your trailer.

Next, identify the following items and 
ensure that they are all securely mounted
and in working order: DEF gauge, left and
right turn signals, four-way flashers, high
beams, mirrors, windshield, and windshield 
wipers. Also, ensure that the windshield wiper
fluid, city horn and air horn, defroster and
floor heater are in working order.
