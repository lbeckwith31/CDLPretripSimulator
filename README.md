# CDLPretripSimulator
A program I created to help me study for the CDL test.

main.py will not run if you do not have pygame and idlelib installed. Running

```pip install pygame``` and
```pip install idle```
from terminal/ command prompt will solve this problem.

Alternatively, you can run main.exe from the ```dist``` folder.
