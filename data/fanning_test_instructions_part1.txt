Now it's time to check that your low PSI
warning light and buzzer are functioning.
With the ignition still in auxiliary mode, 
fan the brakes (press the brake pedal 
repeatedly) to bring the PSI levels down.

Your low PSI warning light and buzzer should
turn on at no more than 60 and no less than 55
PSI. Be sure to record the PSI level at which
you notice the light and buzzer activating.
