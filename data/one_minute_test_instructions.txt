For the first of three components of the
air brake leak-down test, you must hold your 
foot on the service brake pedal for one full 
minute to ensure the air pressure in your
vehicle's air brake system does not drop 
by more than 4 PSI.

A timer will appear and begin counting down
once you have applied the service pedal by 
pressing the "B" key. DO NOT release the brake
pedal before the 60 seconds is up, otherwise
you will fail your test.

Take note of your current PSI level, as you
will need to verify after 60 seconds that your
brakes have not lost more than 4 PSI.
