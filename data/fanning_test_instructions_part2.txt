If the PSI in your air tanks gets dangerously
low, the emergency spring brakes in your tractor
and trailer must set to bring your combination
vehicle to a stop. 

To verify that this system is in place, continue
fanning your brakes until you notice the tractor
and trailer spring brakes set and the knobs pop 
out. This should be no more than 45 and no less
than 20 PSI.
